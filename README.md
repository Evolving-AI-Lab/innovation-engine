## Notes

This code base is a fork from the [initial project] (https://github.com/Evolving-AI-Lab/fooling).

* It has support for the latest Caffe.
* Experiments are in [here](https://github.com/Evolving-AI-Lab/innovation-engine/tree/master/sferes/exp/images/x)
  * [Novelty Search](https://github.com/Evolving-AI-Lab/innovation-engine/blob/master/sferes/exp/images/x/gecco15/dl_novelty_images_imagenet.cpp)
  * [MAP-Elites](https://github.com/Evolving-AI-Lab/innovation-engine/blob/master/sferes/exp/images/x/gecco15/dl_map_elites_images.cpp)
    * [CPPN without Sine waves](https://github.com/Evolving-AI-Lab/innovation-engine/blob/master/sferes/exp/images/x/gecco15/dl_map_elites_images_no_sine.cpp) experiment shows to create a lot of *recognizable* images.
